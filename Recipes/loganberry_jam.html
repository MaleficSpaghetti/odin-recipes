    <h1>Lagonberry Jam</h1>

    <p>
        Jam refers to a product made of whole fruit cut into pieces or crushed, then heated with water and sugar until it reaches "jelling" or "setting" point, which is achieved through the action of natural or added pectin. It is then sealed in containers. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups loganberries  </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon butter </li>
        <li>6 and 1/2 cups white sugar </li>
        <li>1 (2 ounce) package powdered fruit pectin  </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Step One: Inspect seven 8-ounce jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until jam is ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water.</li>
    <li>Step Two: Crush berries in a bowl. Place 1/2 of the crushed berries into a sieve or cheesecloth to remove some seeds if desired. Transfer all berries to a large pot.
    </li>
    <li>Step Three: Stir in sugar and add butter to reduce foaming if desired. Bring mixture to a full rolling boil on high heat, stirring constantly. Stir in pectin quickly. Return to a full boil and boil for exactly 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and skim off any foam with metal spoon.
    </li>
    <li>Step Four: Ladle jam into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/8 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe rims with a moist paper towel to remove any residue. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly.
    </li>
    <li>Step Five: Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and use a holder to lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by 1 to 2 inches. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Step Six: Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year.

    </ul>
